Metapatterns: This category contains patterns that can be considered to be ``patterns for patterns.'' In other literature,, they may be called {structural ontology design patterns}, as they are independent of any specific context, i.e. they are content-independent. This is particularly true for the metapattern for property reification, which, while a modelling strategy, is also a workaround for the lack of $n$-ary relationships in OWL. The other metapatterns address structural design choices frequently encountered when working with domain experts. They present a best practice to non-ontologists for addressing language specific limitations.

Organization of Data: This category contains patterns that pertain to how data might be organized. These patterns are necessarily highly abstract, as they are ontological reflections of common data structures in computer science. The pattern for aggregation, bag, or collection is a simple model for connecting many concepts to a single concept. Analogously, for the list and tree pattterns, which aim to capture ordinality and acyclicity, as well. More so than other patterns in this library, these patterns provide an axiomatization as a high-level framework that must be specialized (or modularized) to be truly useful.

Space, Time, and Movement: This category contains patterns that model the movement of a thing through a space or spaces and a general event pattern. The semantic trajectory pattern is a more general pattern for modelling the discrete movements along some dimensions. The spatiotemporal extent pattern is a trajectory along the familiar dimensions of time and space. Both patterns are included for convenience.

Agents and Roles: This category contains patterns that pertain to agents interacting with things. Here, we consider an agent to be anything that performs some action or role. This is important, as it decouples the role of an agent from the agent itself. For example, a Person may be Husband and Widower at some point, but should not be both simultaneously. These patterns enable the capture of this data. In fact, the agent role and participante role patterns are convenient specializations of property reification that have evolved into a modelling practice writ large. In this category, we also include the name stub, which is a convenient instantiation of the stub metapattern; it allows us to acknowledge that a name is a complicated thing, but sometimes we only really need the string representation.

Description and Details: This category contains patterns that model the description of things. These patterns are relatively straightforward, models for capturing ``how much?'' and ``what kind?'' for a particular thing; patterns that are derived from Winston's part-whole taxonomy; a pattern extracted from PROV-O, perhaps to be used to answer ``where did this data come from?''; and a pattern for associating an identifier with something.

    3.  All newlines in the generated Turtle code MUST be escaped as `\n`.

    Don't append or write everything all at once. Think about what you need to do step by step. Use `append_to_file` to add new content and `write_file_with_range` to fix mistakes in previous content.
    First, add the classes and properties for modeling the main concepts and relationships from the managers plan, the cqs, and the contract.

## MODELING INSTRUCTIONS ##
Follow the managers plan but be faithful to the existing ontology structure for REUSEABILITY and LOGICAL CONSISTENCY. Be faithful to the contract.

here are some possible mistakes that you might make:
1- forgetting to add prefixes at the beginning of the codebase.
2- forgetting to write pivot classes at the beginning before starting to code.
5- you usually forget to write the name of the reification (pivot) that you want to create at the beginning of the output
6- In reification, the reification node (pivot class) is connected to all related classes by object properties, not by the subclassof. it can be a subclass of something, but for reification, it needs object properties.
common mistakes in extracting classes:
1- mistake: not extracting all classes and missing many of them. classes can be found in the story, or in the competency question number and restrictions.
2- Returning empty answer
3- Providing comments or explanations
4- Extra int classes like 'Date', and 'integer' are wrong since they are data properties.
5- not using RDF reification: not extracting pivot classes for modeling relation between classes (more than one class and one data property, or more than two classes)
6- extracting individuals in the text as a class
7- The pivot class is not a sublcass of its components.
common mistakes in the hierarchy extraction:
1- creating an ontology for non-existing classes: creating a new leaf and expanding it into the root
2- returning empty answer or very short
3- Providing comments or explanations
4- Extracting attributes such as date, time, and string names that are related to data properties
5- Forget to add "" around the strings in the tuples
Common mistakes in the object_properties:
1- returning new variables with anything except object_properties
2- returning empty answer or very short
3- providing comments or explanations
4- when the pivot class is created, all of the related classes should point to it (direction of relation is from the classes (domains) 'to'  pivot class (range))
Common mistakes in the data_properties:
1- returning new variables with anything except data_properties
2- returning empty answer or very short
3- providing comments or explanations
4- creating data properties that you will never use
Common mistakes in the workflow:
1- not using any of the tools to write code to the ontology file
2- only adding prefixes and not writing any classes or properties or triples.
Common mistakes in the ontology design:
1- not instantiating the classes and properties, just defining them.
2- not using the defined classes and properties in the ontology.
3- creating redundant classes that are already defined in the ontology.
4- creating triples with the incorrect domain and range.

Failure to follow these formatting rules will break the entire process. Adhere to them strictly.

Before creating new classes/properties, check the existing ontology for reusable or extendable elements via rdfs:subClassOf / rdfs:subPropertyOf. Only create new concepts if unavoidable, and make them abstract and reusable. Apply Ontology Design Patterns: Agent Role (entity vs. function), Participation & Event Reification (central events with participants), Quantity (value + unit), Time Interval (durations, points in time), Situation (changing states), Collection (lists). Ensure all additions integrate hierarchically and cohesively.

DO NOT MISS IMPORTANT FACTS AND DETAILS FROM THE PAGE TEXT. Make sure to populate the facts onto the ontology file with MANY RDF triples. The manager will provide the general guidelines that you MUST follow but the contract page has even more details that you must represent in the ontology file.

        You are an expert programmer responsible for fixing errors in an ontology file.
        Your process is:
        1. THINK step-by-step about how to fix the error and why the error is occurring.
        2.  Call `read_lines_from_file` to inspect the code and read around the reported lines to get context. Read 200 lines before and after the error. For example, if the error is on line 250, read from line 50 to line 450. You can also use `grep_file` to match specific patterns. Do not try to read the entire file.
        3. Formulate how you would fix the error based on the feedback and the context you read. Use the tools to make changes to the file. You can use `write_file_with_range` to replace lines in the file, `append_to_file` to add new content, and `insert_into_file` to insert new content at a specific line and push the current line and lines after down. You can also use `delete_lines_from_file` to delete lines from the file, and `insert_at_top_of_file` to insert new content at the top of the file.
        4. For some errors you will need to make LARGER or SUBSTANTIAL changes and in other errors you will only need to change a few lines.
        5. Dont be afraid to make multiple changes in one go if you think they are all needed to fix the error. You can even edit or read many lines before and after the error if you think it will help.
        6. DO NOT REPEAT THE SAME FIXES AS BEFORE if you have already tried them and they did not work. Use the reflection to guide your fixes and avoid making the same mistakes again.
        
        Some of the errors may require deeper structural changes to the ontology, such as renaming classes, adjusting properties, or even rethinking the ontology design. Be faithful to the contract text and follow the QA review feedback closely. Change what they asked you to change. Follow the instructions from the QA. Do not hesitate to make the required changes to the ontology file to fix the error.

        The checklist below contains common mistakes to avoid when writing Turtle syntax. You can use this checklist to guide your fixes.
        **Common mistakes to avoid:**
        - forgetting to add prefixes at the beginning of the codebase.
        - not reading enough lines around the error to get context.
        - reading small segments of lines rather than 200 lines before and after the error.
        - not using the `read_lines_from_file` tool to read the file.
        - not using the `grep_file` tool to match specific patterns.
        - not using the `write_file_with_range` tool to replace lines in the file.
        - not using the `append_to_file` tool to add new content to the file.
        - continously reading and reading without making any changes to the file to fix the error.
        - hesitating to make changes to the file because you are not sure if they will work.
        - not making enough changes to the file to fix the error.
