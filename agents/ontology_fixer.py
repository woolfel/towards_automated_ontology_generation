You have access to two tools: `read_lines_from_file` and `write_file_with_range`.
Your process is:
1.  Carefully analyze the provided error message.
2. THINK step-by-step about how to fix the error.
3.  Call `read_lines_from_file` to inspect the code and read around the reported lines to get context. You can also use `grep_file` to match specific patterns. DO NOT try to read the entire file. JUST read some lines before and after the error. You might want to read 30 before and 30 after.
4.  Formulate the corrected code block.
5.  Call `write_file_with_range` to replace only the incorrect lines with your fix. Specify the `start_line` and `end_line` precisely.
6. For some errors you will need to make LARGER or SUBSTANTIAL changes and in other errors you will only need to change a few lines.
7.  If your first fix doesn't work, analyze the new error message, re-apply the checklist, read the file again, and try a different fix.

YOU MUST DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE, PROPOSE A FIX, AND THEN APPLY IT.

Once you have read enough lines around the error, you MUST use the `write_file_with_range` tool to write your fix.

--- TURTLE SYNTAX CHECKLIST ---

MISTAKES TO AVOID

Using a prefixed name with an undefined prefix (e.g., ex:Thing without declaring @prefix ex:).

Forgetting . at the end of a triple (subject–predicate–object must end with a period).

Confusing ; and , (; separates predicates for the same subject; , separates multiple objects for the same predicate).

Omitting < > around full IRIs (write <http://example.org/Thing>, not http://example.org/Thing).

Using relative IRIs without a base/@base declaration.

Declaring the same prefix twice with different IRIs unintentionally.

Using : (empty prefix) without explicitly declaring it (many parsers treat this as an error).

Mismatching quotes in string literals ("abc or \"""abc").

Forgetting to escape quotes or backslashes inside strings ("He said \"hi\"").

Mixing language tag and datatype on the same literal ("color"@en^^xsd:string is illegal).

Putting a datatype on a non-string literal incorrectly (42^^xsd:integer is fine; 42.^^xsd:decimal is not).

Writing booleans as bare words in contexts expecting strings, or quoting booleans when a boolean is expected (true/false are boolean literals; "true" is a string).

Using a (shorthand for rdf:type) in subject or object position; a can only be a predicate.

Using a as a prefix (a:Thing) instead of the keyword a.

Leaving a blank node property list [] with no predicates or not attached to a triple.

Misclosing blank nodes or collections (unbalanced [] or ()).

Misusing RDF collections: writing commas inside () or forgetting that () represents an rdf:nil-terminated list.

Trailing ; or , at the end of a subject’s predicate/object list (must end with . not ; or ,).

Using comments incorrectly (only # starts a comment; anything after # to end of line is ignored).

Placing @prefix or @base lines after using those prefixes/relative IRIs (declare before use to avoid parser errors).

Using invalid characters in prefixed local names (spaces, leading -, or illegal punctuation).

Case errors in keywords (@prefix, @base, true, false, a are case-sensitive).

Using ^^ with something that is not an IRI or prefixed name ("x"^^string is invalid; must be "x"^^xsd:string or "x"^^<IRI>).

Forgetting whitespace between tokens, causing accidental concatenation (e.g., ex:s1ex:p).

Ending the file without a final newline or with partial token (some parsers choke on incomplete last line).

Assuming Turtle allows JSON-like objects or commas between triples (it doesn’t; triples end with . only).
